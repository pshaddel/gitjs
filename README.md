## What is Git or Version Control?

Git, or version control in general, serves as a tool to track the progress of a project over time. It allows for easy navigation through the project's history, providing the ability to review how the code looked at specific times in the past.

## Why Understand Git?

Understanding the workings of Git is essential. Blindly executing commands isn't enough when things go wrong. A deeper comprehension of this everyday tool not only ensures effective problem-solving but also adds a layer of excitement to your work.

## Implementation

The article introduces Gitj, a simplified version control system for the purpose of understanding Git internals. The initial implementation involves fundamental commands like `init` and `add`.

### Command: `init`

The `init` command initiates the project, creating essential folders and files that Git uses to manage the repository. The implementation involves setting up the `.gitj` directory, including subdirectories like `objects` and `refs`, along with the essential files for branches and the current HEAD.

### Command: `add`

The `add` command stages files to be committed later. It computes the hash of a file and stores it in the `objects` folder. If the file already exists, Git doesnâ€™t duplicate it, optimizing storage. The process involves hashing file contents and organizing them based on their hashes in the `.gitj` directory.

### Command: `commit`

The `commit` command creates a snapshot of the project. It involves the creation of a commit object with necessary metadata such as author, committer, date, commit message, a pointer to the tree object representing the project's state, and the parent commit hash.

### Tree Object

The article explores the concept of the `tree` object, which represents the structure of files and folders within a project. It elaborates on how the `tree` object allows users to visualize the project's layout at a specific time.

### Git Checkout

The `checkout` command in Git changes the current branch or commit reference. It involves updating the HEAD file to point to the desired commit or branch.
